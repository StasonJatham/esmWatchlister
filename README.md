# esmWatchlister.ps1

McAfee ESM RuleExport Parser to list all Usecases with Watchlists. This helps you clean up your old Watchlists by showing you where which watchlist is used. Feel free to refactor and make this better. I just wrote it as a quick and dirty solution to a quick and dirty problem.

## Usage
<code>esmWatchlister.ps1</code>  
<code>esmWatchlister.ps1 -file path/to/file/RuleExport.xml</code>

## Ideas 
- [ ] Export to CSV/XLS/TXT
- [ ] Generate new rule without certain Watchlists for easy import 
- [ ] Export "RuleExport" with ESM API
